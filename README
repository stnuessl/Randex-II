Randex-II

Randex (Random Excercise) is a tool to randomly place people (or anything labeled with an identifier)  to different positions or stations one after the other. Randex will 
always leave a gap for an identifier between two different positions. 

Patrick Hiemeyer commissioned Randex to Steffen Nuessle, a computer science student at the University of Applied Sciences in Constance, Germany.
Patrick who was in charge of the excercises at his flight controller apprenticeship needed a tool to quickly assign his fellow students to different positions meeting 
certain requierments during their excercise runs. 
For that reason Randex was created.

Randex is releases under the MIT-License.
